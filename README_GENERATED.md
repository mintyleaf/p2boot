### External Data, Input Sources:

### TODOs:

* None found.

### Summary:

The code defines a function `NewHost` that creates a new libp2p host. It first generates a private key using either a random source or a deterministic source based on the provided seed. If a private key string is provided, it decodes it from base16 format and unmarshals it into a crypto.PrivKey object.

The function then creates a multiaddr for the host, using the provided port. Finally, it creates a new libp2p host using the generated private key and the multiaddr. The host is returned along with any errors encountered during the process.

### TODOs:

### Summary:
#### NewKDHT function:
This function creates a new KDHT (Key-Value Distributed Hash Table) instance using the provided context and host. It first initializes an empty slice of options for the KDHT. Then, it appends the `dht.ModeAutoServer` option to the slice, which enables the KDHT to act as both a client and a server.

Next, it calls the `dht.New` function to create a new KDHT instance using the provided context, host, and options. If an error occurs during this process, the function returns nil and the error.

After creating the KDHT instance, the function calls the `Bootstrap` method on the KDHT to bootstrap the DHT. This process involves connecting to other nodes in the network and establishing a connection to the DHT. If an error occurs during bootstrapping, the function returns nil and the error.

Finally, if the KDHT is successfully created and bootstrapped, the function returns the KDHT instance and nil. Otherwise, it returns nil and the error encountered during the process.

### External Data, Input Sources:

### Summary:

The code defines a dedicated Kademlia DHT bootstrap node. It starts by parsing command-line flags for the seed value, port number, and private key string. Then, it creates a context and initializes a host using the provided configuration. The host's addresses and ID are printed to the console.

Next, a Kademlia DHT is created and attached to the host. The code then prints a message indicating that the bootstrap node is active and provides the addresses to connect to it. Finally, a signal handler is set up to gracefully shut down the node when interrupted by signals like SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGHUP.

The `waitSignal` function handles the signal and closes the host, ensuring a clean exit. The `art` function prints a colorful figure representing the Kademlia DHT bootstrap node.

Edge cases:
- If the private key string is not provided, a new private key will be generated using a random source.
- If the seed value is 0, a new private key will be generated using a random source.
- If the port number is not provided, the default port will be used.
